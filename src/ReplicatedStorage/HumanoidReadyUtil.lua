        -- * the character might not be in the dm by the time CharacterAdded fires
        -- ** constantly check consistency with player.Character and abort if CharacterAdded is fired again
        -- * Humanoid may not exist immediately, and by the time it's inserted the character might be deparented.
        -- * RootPart probably won't exist immediately.
        -- ** by the time RootPart is inserted and Humanoid.RootPart is set, the character or the humanoid might be deparented.
