	-- removal, start simulating the ragdoll, and replicate physics data. Meanwhile the other body
	-- parts would be frozen in air on the server and other clients until physics data arives from
	-- the owner. The ragdolled player wouldn't see it, but other players would.

	-- consistent mechanism and network ownership unit root. If we did disable the root joint we'd
	-- be creating a new, seperate network ownership unit that we would have to wait for the server

	-- visual momentum we want to do this on the machine that controls animation state for the
	-- character and will be simulating the ragdoll, in this case the client.
